# stark

A stack-based compiled programming language

## TODO

- [ ] Compilation
- [ ] Loops
- [ ] Type system
    - Somehow validate that functions are using the correct args
    - Function overloading of sorts (maybe just for native functions,
      i.e., print)- both `10 print` and `"hello" print` should work
- [ ] Functions
- [ ] Macros
- [ ] Imports
- [ ] Linking with libc
- [ ] extern functions
- [ ] Better CLI
- [ ] structs
- [ ] pointers
